# Marker genes generated by DGEA of ST data and single cell data of the MCA according to the RMarkdown documention provided in this study. Markers were used to define central and portal clusters in this study

* ST-central-markers.csv - central vein markers (cluster 2) of ST data using the `Liver-ST` script
* ST-portal-markers.csv - portal vein markers (cluster 1) of ST data using the `Liver-ST` script
* sc-central-markers.csv - central hepatocyte markers of MCA single cell data data using the `Liver-ST` script
* sc-portal-markers.csv - portal hepatocyte markers of MCA single cell data data using the `Liver-ST` script
* markers_cluster5.txt - vector of marker genes of cluster 5 generated using the `Liver-ST` script
* markers_cluster5.txt - vector of overlapping marker genes of `markers_cluster5.txt` and `sc-halpern/lcms/lcm_all.txt` from DGEA performed in `scripts/review-ST-Liver-scAnalysis.Rmd` 
* sc-halpern/ - folder containing short lists and complete lists of DEG for annotated celltypes retrieved using `scripts/review-ST-Liver-scAnalysis.Rmd` to generate expression by distance plots for revision process
* st-lec/ - folder containing short and complete lists of marker genes for the annotated celltypes `endo` for endothelial cells, `kupffer` for kupffer cells and `lcm` for liver capsular macrophages extracted using `scripts/review-ST-Liver-scAnalysis.Rmd` which are also present in our spatial data
* immune_short.txt - shortlist of genes with the GO-term  `immune system process` present in spatial data
